# Known Issues, Bugs, and Stubs

Last updated: 2026-03-23 (session 15 — 10 tasks)

---

## Fixed this session (session 7 — Sprint 1)

- ✅ Duplicate `buildRptFormModal` / `closeRptFormMo` — already resolved; backlog entry was stale
- ✅ Cloudflare Proxy URL had no Test button — added (AI & Integrations modal)
- ✅ Rails API auto-save: logout (confirmed), report generation, 30-min timer — all wired
- ✅ GitHub Actions auto-deploy — `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` created (need to flip Pages source to GitHub Actions in repo settings)
- ✅ Hardcoded login replaced with Rails JWT auth — falls back to local if Rails unreachable
- ✅ Users table + has_secure_password deployed to Fly.io
- ✅ Admin user email updated to thewholeywaterproject@gmail.com on production
- ⚠️ `sendRptChatMsg()` and `updateFinForm()` — still stubs, `console.warn` added for visibility

---

## Fixed in session 6

- ✅ Connection status dot added to page header (top right, fixed position)
- ✅ Status panel (slide-in from right, 6 services, individual Test buttons)
- ✅ Drive sync recurses into subfolders
- ✅ Drive sync shows total files found vs new
- ✅ Status dot HTML placement bug fixed
- ✅ Print function newline bug fixed
- ✅ Redirect URI trailing slash fixed
- ✅ Rails API "Connect via Rails API" button in AI & Integrations
- ✅ Cloudflare Worker updated (/token, /refresh, /health endpoints)
- ✅ Rails API deployed to Fly.io
- ✅ oauth_states DB table created (PKCE stored in DB, not session)
- ✅ Email-only OAuth confirmed working end to end

---

## Fixed in previous sessions

- ✅ AI & Integrations modal broken by function hoisting
- ✅ Login dev-mode bypass (empty fields)
- ✅ Login credentials set to admin / twwp2024
- ✅ Phase 2 OAuth Client ID field enabled
- ✅ Gemini model updated to gemini-2.5-flash
- ✅ Test AI Key button in AI & Integrations
- ✅ Per-feature model selector

---

## Fixed 2026-03-23 (health check bugs)

- ✅ `doLogin()` — `checkRailsAPISync()` now called 1 s after JWT login success
- ✅ `doLogout()` — `saveToRailsAPI()` now awaited before `location.reload()`
- ✅ `aiCallJSON()` — KB injection added; doc upload, Classify Folder, and receipt AI now read the knowledge base

## Current bugs

### A1 — Google OAuth drive scope (scope changed, re-auth needed)
**Update (session 11):** Scope changed from `drive.file` to full `drive`. This may resolve the Google rejection.
**What to do:** Re-connect via "Connect via Rails API" in AI & Integrations. Users must re-authorise to get the new scope.
**Note:** There are TWO OAuth Client IDs in Cloud Console.
Active one: `...39mavd5fmtl0s688dcfa26gdq64sjvkd`
Old broken one: `...nljl` — do not use.

### ✅ A2 — Duplicate `buildRptFormModal` — RESOLVED
Already gone in current file. Backlog item was based on stale line numbers.

### ✅ A3 — Duplicate `closeRptFormMo` — RESOLVED
Same as A2.

### ✅ A4 — `sendRptChatMsg()` — FIXED (session 9)
Report AI chat now fully wired. Supports all four providers (Gemini, Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter). Includes report context (title, type, waterhouse) and KB injection in system prompt. Maintains multi-turn `rptChatHistory`.

### ✅ A5 — `updateFinForm()` — FIXED (session 9)
Financial form now adapts on type change: contact label and placeholder update (Paid To / Donor Name / Reimburse To / Received From), waterhouse row hidden for donation and income types, category pre-selects a sensible default.

### ✅ A6 — Contacts CSV import — FIXED (session 9)
`impContactsCSV()` now opens a file picker, parses CSV via `parseCsvText()`, auto-maps columns (name, email, phone, type, org, addr, tags, notes), deduplicates by email, and imports with a confirmation dialog.

### ✅ A8 — Rails `/api/drive/upload` endpoint — FIXED (session 11)
Endpoint existed but returned raw Drive response without `webViewLink`. Fixed: added `?fields=id,webViewLink,name`, defaulted mime_type to `text/html`, returns clean `{id, webViewLink, filename}`. Frontend updated to send JSON body instead of FormData.

### A9 — Google OAuth scope re-authorisation required
Changed from `drive.file` to full `drive` scope (session 11). Any users who previously connected via Google OAuth must **re-connect** — old tokens have insufficient scope. The re-auth flow will request the new scope.

### A7 — `dtk_I1` seeded twice
Duplicate dev task ID.

### ✅ NEW — Calendar CRUD undefined — FIXED (session 13)
`openCalEventMo`, `editCalEvent`, `saveCalEvent`, `deleteCalEvent` were referenced in the UI but never defined. Now fully implemented with recurrence field, delete button, waterhouse dropdown population, and store upsert/remove.

## Stubs (built UI, not wired)

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Receipt Inbox AI Parse tab | Tab exists, no AI call |
| Deployments → inventory auto-move | Checkbox not built |
| Shop Destinations management UI | Store exists, no UI |
| ✅ Report chat | Wired (session 9) |
| ✅ .docx extraction | mammoth.js (session 10) |
| Tap-Map sync | JSON export works, Rails endpoint not built |
| HA test connection | Fields saved, no test call |
| Slack / Zapier webhooks | Fields saved, no event wiring |
| Google Drive OAuth via Rails API | Deployed, drive.file scope failing |
| Multi-device sync | Needs OAuth fix first |
| Document Creation tab | Not built |
| ✅ Email Registry tab | Built (session 11); Send button added (session 12) |
| Drive backup on logout | Code written, needs OAuth |
| Auto-save to Drive every 30 min | Timer set, needs OAuth |
| `callModelForFeature()` | Built but not wired into autofill/import/classify |

## Data model gaps

**Locations:** ha_url, device_node_id, filter_configuration, installer, commission_date
**Contacts:** twwp_role, referrer_id, appointment_date, term_length
**Calendar events:** is_approval_item, related_record, recurrence
**Maintenance jobs:** entity_id, technician_id, installer_id

---

## Important notes

- **Gemini model:** gemini-2.5-flash — deprecates frequently, use Test AI Key to verify
- **Gemini keys from aistudio.google.com** — NOT Google Cloud Console
- **Service Account JSON must never go in browser** — private key exposed in DevTools
- **Fly.io auto-stop** wakes machines on request (~30-60 sec first request)
- **Two OAuth Client IDs exist** — use the newer one ending in ...39mavd5
- **Rails production key:** 3c1cda80ab038529d03d3fceb4075dca — keep safe

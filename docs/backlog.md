## GROUP U — Multi-Organisation Architecture

**North star:** TWWP is org #1 and the reference implementation. Every feature
must be designed so a second organisation can plug in with their own data,
branding, users and config — without touching the code.

- ⬜ `organisations` table in Rails — name, slug, logo_url, brand_colour, plan, active
- ⬜ `org_id` on all Rails tables: users, ops_sessions, ops_syncs
- ⬜ `org_id` on all localStorage stores: contacts, locations, financials, tasks,
  projects, inventory, deployments, kits, maintenance, calEvents, monitorData,
  services, assets, documents, campaigns
- ⬜ Org context set at login — JWT includes org_id
- ⬜ Org switcher in app header (for users who belong to multiple orgs)
- ⬜ Per-org branding — logo, app name, brand colour loaded from org config
- ⬜ Per-org feature flags — enable/disable modules per org
- ⬜ Per-org integration config — each org has own API keys, Drive folder, HA URL
- ⬜ Org admin role — can manage users and config for their org only
- ⬜ Super-admin role — can see and manage all orgs
- ⬜ White-label export — package a configured instance for a new org
- ⬜ Onboarding wizard for new orgs — name, logo, first admin user, modules
- ⬜ Tap-Map sync scoped per org (future)
- ⬜ Billing/plan awareness (future — Stripe integration scoped per org)

- ⬜ Document Creation tab
